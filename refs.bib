  annote = {This paper presents the Parallel BGL, a generic C++
            library for distributed graph computation. Like the
            sequential Boost Graph Library (BGL) upon which it
            is based, the Parallel BGL applies the paradigm of
            generic programming to the domain of graph
            computations. Emphasizing efficient generic
            algorithms and the use of concepts to specify the
            requirements on type parameters, the Parallel BGL
            also provides flexible supporting data structures
            such as distributed adjacency lists and external
            property maps. The generic programming approach
            simultaneously stresses flexibility and efficiency,
            resulting in a parallel graph library that can adapt
            to various data structures and communication models
            while retaining the efficiency of equivalent
            hand-coded programs. Performance data for selected
            algorithms are provided demonstrating the efficiency
            and scalability of the Parallel BGL.}

        abstract = {GPS (for Graph Processing System) is a complete open-source system we developed for scalable, fault-tolerant, and easy-to-program execution of algorithms on extremely large graphs. This paper serves the dual role of describing the GPS system, and presenting techniques and experimental results for graph partitioning in distributed graph-processing systems like GPS. GPS is similar to Google's proprietary Pregel system, with three new features: (1) an extended API to make global computations more easily expressed and more efficient; (2) a dynamic repartitioning scheme that reassigns vertices to different workers during the computation based on messaging patterns; and (3) an optimization that distributes adjacency lists of high-degree vertices across all compute nodes to improve performance.
In addition to presenting the implementation of GPS and its novel features, we also experiment with the performance effects of static graph partitioning schemes, i.e., assigning vertices to compute nodes "intelligently" before computation begins.

@article{Berger2002,
abstract = {Programmers hoping to achieve performance improvements often use custom memory allocators. This in-depth study examines eight applications that use custom allocators. Surprisingly, for six of these applications, a state-of-the-art general-purpose allocator (the Lea allocator) performs as well as or better than the custom allocators. The two exceptions use regions, which deliver higher performance (improvements of up to 44\%). Regions also reduce programmer burden and eliminate a source of memory leaks. However, we show that the inability of programmers to free individual objects within regions can lead to a substantial increase in memory consumption. Worse, this limitation precludes the use of regions for common programming idioms, reducing their usefulness.$\backslash$nWe present a generalization of general-purpose and region-based allocators that we call reaps. Reaps are a combination of regions and heaps, providing a full range of region semantics with the addition of individual object deletion. We show that our implementation of reaps provides high performance, outperforming other allocators with region-like semantics. We then use a case study to demonstrate the space advantages and software engineering benefits of reaps in practice. Our results indicate that programmers needing fast regions should use reaps, and that most programmers considering custom allocators should instead use the Lea allocator.},

abstract = {Processor and memory technology trends show a continual increase in the cost of accessing main memory. Machine designers have tried to mitigate the effect of this trend through a variety of techniques that attempt to reduce or tolerate memory latency. These techniques, unfortunately, have only been partially successful for pointer- manipulating programs. Recent research has demonstrated that these programs can benefit greatly from the complementary approach of reorganizing pointer data structures to improve cache locality. This paper describes how a generational garbage collector can be used to achieve a cache-conscious data layout, in which objects with high temporal affinity are placed next to each other, so they are likely to reside in the same cache block. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of collecting low overhead, real-time profiling information about data access patterns for object-oriented languages, and describes a new copying algorithm that utilizes this information to produce a cache-conscious object layout. Preliminary results indicate that this technique reduces cache miss rates by 21-42$\backslash$\%, and improves program performance by 14-37$\backslash$\%.},

abstract = {Modern architectures require data locality to achieve performance. However, garbage-collected languages like Java limit the ability of programmers to influence object locality, and so impose a significant performance penalty. We present custom object layout, an approach that allows programmers to control object layout in garbage-collected languages. Custom object layout cooperates with copying garbage collection. At collection time, the garbage collector invokes programmer-supplied methods that direct object placement. Custom object layout is particularly effective at improving the locality of classes with well-known traversal patterns, such as dictionary data structures. We show that using custom object layout can reduce cache misses by 50\%-77\% and thus improves the query performance of dictionary data structures by 20\%.},

resident persistent objects-techniques which are commonly referred to as
pointer swizzling-are classified and evaluated. To speed up the access

techniques allow the displacement of objects from the buffer before the

performance of an object manager using no pointer swizzling. The results
of the quantitative evaluation prove that there is no one superior

abstract = {This paper describes Automatic Pool Allocation, a transformation framework that segregates distinct instances of heap-based data structures into seperate memory pools and allows heuristics to be used to partially control the internal layout of those data structures. The primary goal of this work is performance improvement, not automatic memory management, and the paper makes several new contributions. The key contribution is a new compiler algorithm for partitioning heap objects in imperative programs based on a context-sensitive pointer analysis, including a novel strategy for correct handling of indirect (and potentially unsafe) function calls. The transformation does not require type safe programs and works for the full generality of C and C++. Second, the paper describes several optimizations that exploit data structure partitioning to further improve program performance. Third, the paper evaluates how memory hierarchy behavior and overall program performance are impacted by the new transformations. Using a number of benchmarks and a few applications, we find that compilation times are extremely low, and overall running times for heap intensive programs speed up by 10-25\% in many cases, about 2x in two cases, and more than 10x in two small benchmarks. Overall, we believe this work provides a new framework for optimizing pointer intensive programs by segregating and controlling the layout of heap-based data structures.},

@article{Maassen2001,
abstract = {Java offers interesting opportunities for parallel computing. In particular, Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) provides a flexible kind of remote procedure call (RPC) that supports polymorphism. Sun's RMI implementation achieves this kind of flexibility at the cost of a major runtime overhead. The goal of this article is to show that RMI can be implemented efficiently, while still supporting polymorphism and allowing interoperability with Java Virtual Machines (JVMs). We study a new approach for implementing RMI, using a compiler-based Java system called Manta. Manta uses a native (static) compiler instead of a just-in-time compiler. To implement RMI efficiently, Manta exploits compile-time type information for generating specialized serializers. Also, it uses an efficient RMI protocol and fast low-level communication protocols.A difficult problem with this approach is how to support polymorphism and interoperability. One of the consequences of polymorphism is that an RMI implementation must be able to download remote classes into an application during runtime. Manta solves this problem by using a dynamic bytecode compiler, which is capable of compiling and linking bytecode into a running application. To allow interoperability with JVMs, Manta also implements the Sun RMI protocol (i.e., the standard RMI protocol), in addition to its own protocol.We evaluate the performance of Manta using benchmarks and applications that run on a 32-node Myrinet cluster. The time for a null-RMI (without parameters or a return value) of Manta is 35 times lower than for the Sun JDK 1.2, and only slightly higher than for a C-based RPC protocol. This high performance is accomplished by pushing almost all of the runtime overhead of RMI to compile time. We study the performance differences between the Manta and the Sun RMI protocols in detail. The poor performance of the Sun RMI protocol is in part due to an inefficient implementation of the protocol. To allow a fair comparison, we compiled the applications and the Sun RMI protocol with the native Manta compiler. The results show that Manta's null-RMI latency is still eight times lower than for the compiled Sun RMI protocol and that Manta's efficient RMI protocol results in 1.8 to 3.4 times higher speedups for four out of six applications.},

abstract = {Pointer swizzling at page fault time is a novel address translation mechanism that exploits conventional address translation hardware. It can support huge address spaces efficiently without long hardware addresses; such large address spaces are attractive for persistent object stores, distributed shared memories, and shared address space operating systems. This swizzling scheme can be used to provide data compatibility across machines with different word sizes, and even to provide binary code compatibility across machines with different hardware address sizes. Pointers are translated (`swizzled') from a long format to a shorter hardware-supported format at page fault time. No extra hardware is required, and no continual software overhead is incurred by presence checks or indirection of pointers. This pagewise technique exploits temporal and spatial locality in much the same way as a normal virtual memory; this gives it many desirable performance characteristics, especially given the trend toward larger main memories. It is easy to implement using common compilers and operating systems},
