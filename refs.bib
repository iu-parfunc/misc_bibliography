            library for distributed graph computation. Like the
            sequential Boost Graph Library (BGL) upon which it
            is based, the Parallel BGL applies the paradigm of
            generic programming to the domain of graph
            computations. Emphasizing efficient generic
            algorithms and the use of concepts to specify the
            requirements on type parameters, the Parallel BGL
            also provides flexible supporting data structures
            such as distributed adjacency lists and external
            property maps. The generic programming approach
            simultaneously stresses flexibility and efficiency,
            resulting in a parallel graph library that can adapt
            to various data structures and communication models
            while retaining the efficiency of equivalent
            hand-coded programs. Performance data for selected
            algorithms are provided demonstrating the efficiency
            and scalability of the Parallel BGL.}

        abstract = {GPS (for Graph Processing System) is a complete open-source system we developed for scalable, fault-tolerant, and easy-to-program execution of algorithms on extremely large graphs. This paper serves the dual role of describing the GPS system, and presenting techniques and experimental results for graph partitioning in distributed graph-processing systems like GPS. GPS is similar to Google's proprietary Pregel system, with three new features: (1) an extended API to make global computations more easily expressed and more efficient; (2) a dynamic repartitioning scheme that reassigns vertices to different workers during the computation based on messaging patterns; and (3) an optimization that distributes adjacency lists of high-degree vertices across all compute nodes to improve performance.
In addition to presenting the implementation of GPS and its novel features, we also experiment with the performance effects of static graph partitioning schemes, i.e., assigning vertices to compute nodes "intelligently" before computation begins.
